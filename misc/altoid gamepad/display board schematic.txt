# TITLE: Altoids Retro Gamepad - Display Interface Board
# REVISION: 1.0  
# DATE: 2025-06-18
# DESIGNED BY: Assistant
# COMPANY: DIY Project

# This board interfaces the 2.8" TFT display with the main controller
# Located in the top lid of the clamshell design
# Connected via 10-wire ribbon cable through piano hinge

## 2.8" TFT DISPLAY MODULE
# Adafruit #1770 - 2.8" TFT + Resistive Touch
# ILI9341 Controller, 320x240 resolution
# Integrated resistive touch controller

# Display Module (U1) - Adafruit 2.8" TFT Breakout
# Power Connections:
# VIN -> 5V (for backlight)
# 3Vo -> 3V3 (logic supply)  
# GND -> Ground

# SPI Display Interface:
# SCK  -> SPI Clock
# MISO -> SPI Data Out (to Pi)
# MOSI -> SPI Data In (from Pi)
# CS   -> SPI Chip Select
# D/C  -> Data/Command select
# RST  -> Reset (active low)

# Touch Controller Interface:
# T_CLK -> Touch SPI Clock (shared with display)
# T_CS  -> Touch Chip Select  
# T_DIN -> Touch Data In (shared MOSI)
# T_DO  -> Touch Data Out (shared MISO)
# T_IRQ -> Touch Interrupt

## RIBBON CABLE INTERFACE
# Main Board Connection (J1) - 10-pin ribbon connector
# Pin 1  -> 5V Rail
# Pin 2  -> 3V3 Rail
# Pin 3  -> GND
# Pin 4  -> SPI MOSI 
# Pin 5  -> SPI MISO
# Pin 6  -> SPI SCLK
# Pin 7  -> SPI CE0 (Display CS)
# Pin 8  -> Display DC
# Pin 9  -> Display Reset
# Pin 10 -> Touch CS

## DISPLAY CONNECTIONS
# Power Section:
# J1-Pin1 (5V) -> Display VIN
# J1-Pin2 (3V3) -> Display 3Vo  
# J1-Pin3 (GND) -> Display GND

# SPI Display Interface:
# J1-Pin4 (MOSI) -> Display MOSI
# J1-Pin5 (MISO) -> Display MISO  
# J1-Pin6 (SCLK) -> Display SCK
# J1-Pin7 (CE0) -> Display CS
# J1-Pin8 (DC) -> Display D/C
# J1-Pin9 (Reset) -> Display RST

# Touch Interface:
# J1-Pin4 (MOSI) -> Display T_DIN (shared)
# J1-Pin5 (MISO) -> Display T_DO (shared)
# J1-Pin6 (SCLK) -> Display T_CLK (shared)  
# J1-Pin10 (Touch CS) -> Display T_CS
# Display T_IRQ -> Pi GPIO 27 (via ribbon pin 11 if added)

## PASSIVE COMPONENTS
# C1: 100nF ceramic - 5V power decoupling
# C2: 100nF ceramic - 3V3 power decoupling
# R1: 10K ohm - Reset pullup (optional, display has internal)

## MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS
# Board Size: 60mm x 40mm (fits behind display)
# Mounting: 4x M2.5 holes in corners
# Display Cutout: Precise rectangular opening
# Connector Placement: Edge nearest hinge
# Component Height: All components on back side

## PCB SPECIFICATIONS  
# Layer Count: 2 (Top + Bottom)
# Thickness: 1.6mm standard
# Surface Finish: HASL or ENIG
# Solder Mask: Black or Blue
# Silkscreen: White component labels

# ASSEMBLY NOTES:
# - Display mounts to front of PCB
# - All other components on back
# - Ribbon connector at hinge edge
# - Test points for SPI signals
# - Fiducials for assembly alignment

## ROUTING CONSIDERATIONS
# - Keep SPI traces short and equal length
# - Use ground plane on bottom layer
# - Wide power traces (0.5mm minimum)
# - Minimize via usage on SPI signals
# - Route traces away from display area

## CONNECTION VERIFICATION
# Total ribbon cable connections: 10 wires
# 3 power (5V, 3V3, GND)
# 6 SPI/control signals
# 1 touch chip select
# Optional: Touch IRQ (11th wire)

# This simple interface board allows clean
# mechanical separation between display and
# main controller while maintaining reliable
# electrical connection through the hinge
